# Meme Streets

## Description

Meme streets is a 8-bit retro style side scrolling beat-em-up where Memes, old and new, battle for survival. Some memes have chosen a heroic path, many more have gone bad. And now our heroes need to bring down their villanous counterparts or else lose the city to crime and corruption.

# Tools Used

* Godot 2.1
* Paint.net
* GIMP

## Retro Style

We chose the NTSC Atari 2600 color palette for this project. Our assets were converted or created in this palette. We found this cool website where they had the .gpl format of the palette that we downloaded and used in Gimp. We also converted the palette into txt format (with the alpha channel added) for Paint.net usage.
