# Meme Streets

## Description

Meme streets is a 8-bit retro style side scrolling beat-em-up where Memes, old and new, battle for survival. Some memes have chosen a heroic path, many more have gone bad. And now our heroes need to bring down their villanous counterparts or else lose the city to crime and corruption.

# Tools Used

* Godot 2.1
* Paint.net
* GIMP

## Retro Style

We chose to base our 256 color palette off of Sega Mega Drives' color palette (the midtones). We are running our resolution at 320x240 (so 4:3 aspect ratio). Originally we were going to use a color palette from the Atari 2600 but we wanted a few more colors to work with in our assets and in the assets we converted. Palette files (in various formats) can be found in the misc directory.
